		&quot Cryolophosaurus roamed the planet during the early Jurassic period and while it is certainly not a commonly known dinosaur it was unique in a variety of ways. Along with its unique physical appearance the Cryolophosaurus also lived in a unique area of the world that many other species of dinosaur tended to avoid. Jokingly referred to as the â€œElvisaurusâ€� the Cryolophosaurus was a large carnivorous dinosaur that is of great significance to the paleontological world not just for its unique status as a meat eater that roamed where most others would not go but also because it is the oldest known Tetanuran that has ever been discovered in the history of paleontological discovery.&quot
