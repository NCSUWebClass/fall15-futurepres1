		&quot Triceratops was the last and largest of the horned dinosaurs. It may have been one of the most common dinosaurs in the North American West at the time of Tyrannosaurus rex. These dinosaurs are often pictured traveling in large groups, but the biggest gathering of Triceratops ever found consisted of three youngsters. Perhaps it lived only in family groups. Triceratops nipped at low-growing plants with its beak and cut them with its 800 little teeth. When walking, Triceratopsâ€™s toes pointed outward, a primitive posture common to most dinosaurs. Given its multi-ton weight, it did not walk quickly.&quot
