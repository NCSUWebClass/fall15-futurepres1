		&quot Dilophosaurus takes its name from its most unusual feature—its rounded double crest. But it had other odd features. Its jawbones were not strongly connected. There was a gap behind its forward teeth. And its teeth had a narrow base. So they might have broken off more easily in feeding than the teeth of other big meat eaters. Some scientists think that with all of these features, Dilophosaurus could only have eaten fish or already dead animals. Others disagree and believe that Dilophosaurus was a capable hunter, able to take on the biggest plant eaters of its time—the prosauropods.&quot
