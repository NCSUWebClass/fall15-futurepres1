		&quot Allosaurus was the king of the Jurassic predators in North America. Powerful jaws held nearly 70 sharp, thick teeth. The claws on its three-fingered hands measured up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) long. Allosaurus did not have a very large skull or teeth for an animal of its size, but the bones of its skull were flexible. The lower jawbones could bend outward, making a large space in its mouth for holding meat.&quot
