		&quot Apatosaurus is the correct name for the dinosaur once known as Brontosaurus. Brontosaurus was named in the late 1800s from bones of a dinosaur already named Apatosaurus. Scientists realized the mistake in 1911, but the name Brontosaurus stuck for many years. By any name, Apatosaurus was a huge dinosaur. It roamed the North American West along with many other giant plant eaters, including Diplodocus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Camarasaurus. How did all of these dinosaurs share the same food sources? Perhaps by feeding at different heights from the forest trees.&quot
