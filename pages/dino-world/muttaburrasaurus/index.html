		&quot Muttaburrasaurus was a large, plant-eating ornithopod from the Early Cretaceous of eastern Australia. It is one of the most complete dinosaurs from Australia - only Minmi is more complete - and the first to be cast and mounted for display. Muttaburrasaurus had an unusual skull with a long, rounded snout that had a hollow internal chamber, perhaps to increase the volume of its calls or enhance its sense of smell. - See more at: http://australianmuseum.net.au/muttaburrasaurus-langdoni#sthash.2ejjonQY.dpuf &quot
