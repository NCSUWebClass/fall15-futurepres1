		&quot With its big round nose, long horns, and spiked frill, Diabloceratops is strange looking, even for a dinosaur. Unlike most other centrosaurine ceratopsians, Diabloceratops had long horns above its eyes and a short nose horn, similar to more well-known chasmosaurines such as Triceratops, Kosmoceratops, and Utahceratops. This animal also had a deep snout compared to other members of this group of horned dinosaurs. Like all ceratopsians, Diabloceratops had a beaked mouth for feeding on plants. The ‘Diablo’ in this dinosaur’s name comes from the Latin word for ‘devil’, which is a reference to the large pair of upward and sideways curving horns on the back of its frill.&quot
