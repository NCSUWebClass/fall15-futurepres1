		&quot Pachyrhinosaurus or "thick-nosed lizard", was a type of ceratopsian dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (73-69 mya). It was a large herbivorous ornithiscian and was closely related to the more famous Triceratops. It lived alongside hadrosaurs like Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurs like Edmontonia, and tyrannosaurs like Albertosaurus. It was discovered in Alberta, Canada in 1946 by Charles Sternberg and named in 1950. Its range included Alaska and Alberta.&quot
