		&quot Megalosaurus was the dinosaur that started a great many things including the science of palaeontology,‭ ‬the debate about if dinosaurs should be called names that end with‭ '‬saurus‭' ‬because they are not‭ '‬lizards‭'‬,‭ ‬to lifetimes of fascination about the creatures that once walked the Earth when we ourselves were an evolutionary dream.&quot
