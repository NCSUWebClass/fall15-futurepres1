		&quot Parasaurolophus is one of the last and best known crested duckbills. Like other duckbills, it probably traveled in herds. The fancy crest of this big plant eater has long been of interest to scientists. One paleontologist speculated that it held scent glands, or salt, or helped the animal breathe underwater. But it was, in fact, a trumpet. Experiments have shown that Parasaurolophusâ€™s crest produced a low B-flat sound similar to the sounds elephants and whales make when communicating to their own kind over long distances.&quot
