		&quot Iguanodon was the first dinosaur identified by a scientist more than 180 years ago. Workers in a British forest brought its fossil teeth to a local doctor, Gideon Mantell. Iguanodon was a heavy plant eater, with leg bones built to support its bulk. Its hands had three strong middle fingers, and its wrist bones were joined together for extra strength. Its peculiar thumb spike was set off to the side, which would have been useful for stabbing predators or cutting plants. Its fifth finger was small. It might have been more easily moved to hold food that Iguanodon’s other fingers could not grasp alone. This dinosaur ran on two legs. On its hind legs, Iguanodon had three short, thick toes that were probably padded. The foot pads would help spread the animal’s weight so it could walk comfortably.&quot
