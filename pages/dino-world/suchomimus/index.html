		&quot The discovery of Suchomimus helped towards the more accurate reconstruction of its potentially much larger relative Spinosaurus.‭ ‬Combined with knowledge from the discovery of Baryonyx and new‭ ‬partial skull material attributed to Spinosaurus remains resulted in Spinosaurus finally being given a crocodile-like skull instead that of the more typical theropod skull style.‭ ‬These discoveries combined to help‭ ‬establish a whole new group of theropod dinosaurs,‭ ‬the spinosaurids.&quot
