		&quot Brachiosaurus was a gigantic dinosaur. Scientists have estimated its weight at more than 28 tons (25 metric tons). Its neck and head stood up more than 40 feet (12 meters) in the air. The most complete skeletons found belong to animals not yet fully grown. So Brachiosaurus probably grew even longer and taller than we know. Scientists once thought an animal this heavy could only support itself by living in water. The nostrils on top of its head seemed to support this theory. But the pressure of the water would have made it impossible for these animals to take in air.&quot
